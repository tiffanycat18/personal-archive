  <p>Hi, my name is Tiffany Tran.</p>

  <p>I make art because I feel things deeply.</p>

  <p>I don’t always have answers. I have pieces. Visions. Images. Flashbacks that arise when I’m not searching for them. Creating has been how I’ve learned to sit with all of it: my intensity, my philosophical and psychic thoughts, my passion, my desire, my imagination.</p>

  <p>My background is in visual storytelling – design, photography, film – but what fuels my work are feelings. Much of my work is inspired by personal experience: love, grief, memory, separation, faith, questioning, longing, loss, feeling out of place, and being an outlier –  the moments that are raw, unresolved, intense, and simply heavy – the weight of being human. I want the work I make to feel like someone lived in it. To be flawed. To be felt. To be human.</p>

  <p>I love the poetry of what’s omitted. I believe that what's left out can be just as powerful as what’s shown. A lot of my work begins with questions and creations in search of answers. It’s made by sitting with intensity and discomfort, getting lost, making mistakes, and learning how to move forward without crumbling.</p>

  <p>Making art has helped me through times when I felt disconnected from myself, when I was lost, overwhelmed, scared, or had too much emotion to handle. It’s how I make sense of the things that feel messy, unresolved, or just plain difficult to sit with.</p>

  <p>This is a collection of works I made while learning how to look closer. Some moments I tried to understand. Some moments I’m still processing. Not resolutions. Investigations. Into feeling. Into myself and others. Into loving, losing, and continuing – to empathize, to exist, to honor.</p>
